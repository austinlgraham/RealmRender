# RealmRender

**RealmRender** is an advanced 2D map generation tool designed for worldbuilders, writers, game developers, and anyone passionate about crafting immersive worlds. The program leverages real-world geographical and environmental principles to create realistic maps with features like plate tectonics, ocean currents, climate zones, biomes, and atmospheric circulation. Future updates will include AI assistance, time manipulation, and exportable world data.

## Features
### Current Goals:
- **Realistic Map Generation**:
  - Landmass creation using plate tectonics.
  - Atmospheric circulation, wind patterns, and ocean currents.
  - Climate zones and biome distribution based on environmental factors.
- **Interactive Interface**:
  - User-friendly browser-based interface for real-time interaction.
  - Tools for customization and fine-tuning generated maps.
  
### Future Features:
- **AI Assistance**:
  - Helps users input specific parameters and generates realistic details, including:
    - Fictional minerals, flora, and fauna placement.
    - Civilization placement and historical growth simulation.
- **Time Manipulation**:
  - Move forward and backward through time.
  - Simulate geological and societal evolution.
- **Export Options**:
  - Generate PDFs containing maps and detailed world data.
  - Export raw data in formats like JSON or CSV for further use.

## Technologies
### Current Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Python (scientific modeling, AI integration, PDF generation)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (React, D3.js, Three.js for rendering maps)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial and temporal data management
- **Performance Optimization**: WebAssembly (Rust/C++ for intensive computations)
